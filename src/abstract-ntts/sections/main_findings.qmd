The primary findings indicate that Elasticsearch is a highly effective tool for optimizing address identification processes. This is much more effective than strict searches in a SQL-style database, which lack of analyzers and do not account for spelling errors and acronyms.  
The P1 structure has proven its effectiveness through the evaluation of the quality of identification in an annotated database containing noisy addresses, as well as by comparing its processing time performance with the P2 pipeline.  
This solution is scalable and can be adapted to other country datasets by taking into account the specificities of its national addresses with the boosts. This search engine represents a significant advancement in address data processing, offering data control, independency and reliability for official statistics.
